# Udagram Image Filtering Application

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into two parts:
1. Frontend - Angular web application built with Ionic Framework
2. Backend RESTful API - Node-Express application

In this project, I have reused their existing Udagram application
and convert and extend into a microservice architecture. After the
application is divided into smaller service, I have containerized it
and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster. This includes the deployment
pipeline, scalability, observability, services, networking, and
deployment strategies to service the system. I have then
implementd and interpretd performance, usage, and logs to solve real
problems similar to those they would encounter in the field.
